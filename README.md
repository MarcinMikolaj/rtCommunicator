## General info
The application is a messenger that enables the exchange of messages between users in real time, where the protocol is WebSocket.

In order to be able to log in, the user must first set up his account and then confirm its authenticity by clicking on a special link sent to his e-mail address. After logging in, the user can change the data associated with his account.

The application gives you the ability to create and manage new rooms. Each user we want to add to the room will receive an invitation from us that they can accept or reject. All users in our room can receive and send messages.
